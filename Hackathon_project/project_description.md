Analysis of Normal vs C-Section Deliveries in India

Problem Statement:
C-section (Caesarean) deliveries are increasing in many parts of India, raising concerns about maternal and child health. This project aims to analyse the distribution and trends of normal versus C-section deliveries across different regions and hospitals. It will also explore factors that may influence these rates, such as maternal health, literacy, and healthcare infrastructure.

 Objectives:

This project will answer the following questions:

* What is the overall percentage of normal versus C-section deliveries?
* Which regions have higher rates of C-section deliveries?
* Which hospitals have higher C-section rates?
* Is there any relationship between delivery type and season?
* What percentage of second childbirths are normal when the first delivery was a C-section?
* Why are C-section deliveries increasing?
* How do factors like maternal weight, literacy, and healthcare facilities affect delivery type?
* What are the effects of delivery type on the health of the mother and child?
* How can unnecessary C-section deliveries be reduced in the future?

Scope of Analysis:

* National and regional trends over time
* State/district-wise comparison
* Hospital-level analysis (if data is available)
* Seasonal variations
* Analysis of delivery patterns for first and second births
* Impact of maternal health factors (e.g., overweight vs healthy women)
* Health outcomes for mothers and infants by delivery type
* Recommendations to reduce unnecessary C-sections

Data Requirements:

To answer these questions, the following data will be needed:

* Delivery type (Normal or C-section)
* Year and month of delivery
* State, district, or region
* Hospital name and type (Government or Private)
* Total number of deliveries by type
* Maternal age and health indicators (e.g., weight or BMI)
* Birth order (first or second child)
* Literacy rates and other socioeconomic indicators
* Health outcomes for mothers and infants

Data Sources:

* Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (HMIS)
* data.gov.in datasets
* National Family Health Survey (NFHS) reports
* Sample Registration System (SRS) data
* WHO and UNICEF reports for background information

 Methodology:

* Collect and clean data from reliable sources
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends and patterns
* Use statistical and visual analysis to answer research questions
* Interpret results to identify causes and effects of rising C-section rates
* Suggest recommendations for reducing unnecessary C-sections


 Expected Outcomes:

* Clear insights into normal vs C-section delivery trends
* Identification of regions and hospitals with higher C-section rates
* Analysis of seasonal and maternal health factors
* Understanding of health outcomes for mothers and infants by delivery type
* Recommendations to promote safer delivery practices


 Benefits:

* Helps policymakers and health administrators target areas with high C-section rates
* Supports better planning of maternal health services
* Increases awareness about the risks of unnecessary C-sections
* Contributes to improving maternal and child health outcomes in India
